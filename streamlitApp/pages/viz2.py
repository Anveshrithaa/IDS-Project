		 Within the bill, approximately 3 billion dollars will be spent to improve tree equality [1]. \
		 The money will be used for “tree planting and related activities to increase community tree canopy and \
		 associated societal and climate co-benefits, with a priority for projects that increase tree equity.” \

		Community Survey results. Among these factors, median home values, crime rate, education can be \
