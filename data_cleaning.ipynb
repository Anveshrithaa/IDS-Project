    "The dataset being cleaned is \"City of Pittsburgh Trees\" dataset found from Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees. It contains 45,709 entries and 58 features. The data include trees cared for and managed by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works Forestry Division. In this data, the benefits of the trees are quantified to numerical values and are calculated using the National Tree Benefit Calculator Web Service. Here are all of the features for each tree datapoint. Some interesting ones will be commented. \n",
